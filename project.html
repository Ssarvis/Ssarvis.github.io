      <!-- Summary -->
      <section>
        <h4><b>Summary</b></h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          I conducted the research to determine what
          niche market to enter into for a cloud storage
          app and what features to include in the app.
          Through User Surveys, Personas, Stories,
          and Flows, I discovered the target audience and
          how they would use the app. I also undertook
          all of the branding, summarized it in a Style
          Guide, and implemented the UI via Wireframes,
          Hi-Fi Mockups, Prototypes, and User Testing of
          those deliverables.
        </p>
        <h5>Problem</h5>
        <p>Create a cloud storage app that allows users to
          create recipes, upload videos, images, PDFs, etc., organize content via folders, and share items/folder and vice versa<br>
          <br/>
          AND<br/>
          <br/>
          Figure out a target audience, device focus (web, mobile, or both), and the name and branding of the app.<p>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <p>Modern Garden: a cloud storage app where users can have all of their all-natural, DIY recipes in one place.</p>

        <h4>Discovery and Research</h4>
        <hr>
        <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <p>Since cloud storage for this niche market
          doesn’t exist, I conducted a competitive
          analysis between the three most popular cloud
          storage services: Google Drive, Dropbox, and
          One Drive. By looking at their strengths and
          weaknesses, I determined I definitely wanted
          an ample free storage plan as well as good
          prices for the paid plans. I also determined that
          since the big names in cloud storage are
          multi-purpose and general, the best way for a
          new competitor to enter the market is by
          specializing in something specific, finding an
          unexploited niche.</p>

          <h5>Design Research</h5>
          <p>Once “all natural, DIY recipes” was the decided
            niche, I looked at Pinterest, but it didn’t solve
            the problems. It only provides links to outside
            sources. So I looked at websites and blogs that
            feature these recipes to get an idea of how the
            recipes are displayed, what types of people
            would use this, and how I could later brand the app.</p>

          <img src="images/diy-natural.png" alt="DIY Natural website" class="sidebyside">
          <p>I also looked at Cookpad, a recipe creating and
            sharing app, to get an idea of what to include
            for the recipe creation page. Although food
            recipes are different, so it was merely for inspiration.</p>

          <h5>User Personas</h5>
          <p>From the results of my survey, I came up with
            two personas. The users for this app include an
            enthusiast who wants to consolidate all the
            types of recipes she’s discovered in one place
            for herself and her family and a social media
            influencer who wants to create, organize, and
            share content in tandem with her social media channels.</p>

          <h5>User Flows</h5>
          <p>I generated some User Stories, prioritized them, and selected the following to mature into User Flows:<br>
            I want to create an account<br>
            I want to sign into my account<br>
            I want to create a recipe<br>
            I want to upload files<br>
            I want to share a file/folder<br>
            I want to upgrade my plan</p>

          <h5>Usability Test</h5>
          <p>I turned these wireframes into a clickable prototype and conducted some usability tests.
            My participants had the following feedback:<br>

            Straightforward, but bland. Needs flexibility and functionality.<br>
            Recommended a confirm password box on the sign up page, more detail
            for the payment page (ie: drop down for country selection and a
            question mark next to CVV), magnifying glass in search bar, and
            meter bar to help visualize how much storage is left.</p>

          <h5>Branding</h5>
          <p>Looking again at those DIY recipe websites, I got some inspiration for how I want this app to look. I decided on a peaceful, bright, and modern brand.<br>
            Next I created a mood board and style guide to complete the branding process.
            The greens in the color pallette represent the peacefulness of nature and the pinks give it that bright pop.
            The ample white space and high contrast gives it that modern feel.</p>
          <img src="images/color-palette.png" alt="Color Palette">
          <p>The typeface is sans serif and naturally bold to reflect the modern characteristic and humanist to look more flowy and natural.</p>
          <img src="images/typography.png" alt="Typography">

          <h5>Logo Iterations</h5>
          <img src="images/logo-sketch1.png" alt="Logo sketches" class="sidebyside">
          <img src="images/logo-sketch2.png" alt="More logo sketches" class="sidebyside">
          <p>After a plethora of sketches of a potential logo, I took my favorites to the digital drawing board and initially decided on this:</p>
          <img src="images/logo1.png" alt="Logo 1st iteration">
          <p>I really liked how the M and G served as a visual representation of part of a flower, but the feedback I received was that it looked
            like a tooth and that a more abstract approach might work better. My second attempt looked like this:</p>
          <img src="images/logo2.png" alt="Logo 2nd iteration">
          <p>Now that the logo was more abstract, I was told that it would be better to type out Modern Garden and have the logo be separate to avoid confusion. Here’s the final version:</p>
          <img src="images/logo3.png" alt="Logo final iteration">

          <h5>Hi-fi Mockup Iterations</h5>
          <img src="images/landing-page-hifi1.png" alt="Landing page 1st iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <img src="images/sign-up-hifi.png" alt="Sign up 1st iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <p>For a “modern” app, my 1st attempt was a little dated looking, but a few tweaks after some feedback got things going.</p>
          <img src="images/landing-page-full.png" alt="Landing page final iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <img src="images/sign-up-hifi1.png" alt="Sign up final iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <p>Making the images bigger and the logo smaller give the landing page more balance, expanding the colored sectional and
            skewing the edges makes the page more interesting, and the large thin arrows, shadowed cards for the plan types, and
            sharp edges all push it to that modern look. The pages with the form fields looked pretty good overall, I just removed
            the black borders around the field entries and gave them inner shadows which looks much sleeker.</p>

          <h5>Another Usability Test</h5>
          <p>I did another round of usability tests with my mockups and made the following changes based on the results:<br>
            <br>
            Raise hierarchy of headline on landing page (ie: larger font)<br>
            Add “... and more!” after “paints/dyes” on landing page to indicate options not limited.<br>
            Bold “upgrade storage” on dashboard<br>
            More options on sidebar of dashboard (recent and favorites)<br>
            <br>
            Which created the final product:</p>
          <img src="images/landing-page-full1.png" alt="Landing page final iteration" class="sidebyside">

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>I found that off the bat, I nailed the color scheme. There was good balance of negative space and contrast in colors.
            However, I didn’t have a good eye for modern design, but after some guidance from the lead designer I was able to re-imagine
            my ideas into a more appealing site. As a junior designer with only one project under my belt thus far, I had plenty of doubts
            in my ability in general. There’s a reason the design process exists though. It really helps you walk through every detail and
            make informed design decisions. Constant feedback and iterations is also key. As I keep practicing I’ll only get better and faster.
            With more time I probably would’ve included more detail and functionality. I learned a lot about borders, shadows, iconography, and
            how they’re all incorporated to portray the branding accurately. I’ll use this to make my first iterations a bit more solid and fleshed
            out so that subsequent iterations can be even more detailed and refined.</p>
