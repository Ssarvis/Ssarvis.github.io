        <h4><b>Summary</b></h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          I conducted the research to determine what
          niche market to enter into for a cloud storage
          app and what features to include in the app.
          Through User Surveys, Personas, Stories,
          and Flows, I discovered the target audience and
          how they would use the app. I also undertook
          all of the branding, summarized it in a Style
          Guide, and implemented the UI via Wireframes,
          Hi-Fi Mockups, Prototypes, and User Testing of
          those deliverables.
        </p>

        <h5 id="comp" class="dest">Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <p>Since cloud storage for this niche market
          doesn’t exist, I conducted a competitive
          analysis between the three most popular cloud
          storage services: Google Drive, Dropbox, and
          One Drive. By looking at their strengths and
          weaknesses, I determined I definitely wanted
          an ample free storage plan as well as good
          prices for the paid plans. I also determined that
          since the big names in cloud storage are
          multi-purpose and general, the best way for a
          new competitor to enter the market is by
          specializing in something specific, finding an
          unexploited niche.</p>

          <h5>Design Research</h5>
          <p>Once “all natural, DIY recipes” was the decided
            niche, I looked at Pinterest, but it didn’t solve
            the problems. It only provides links to outside
            sources. So I looked at websites and blogs that
            feature these recipes to get an idea of how the
            recipes are displayed, what types of people
            would use this, and how I could later brand the app.</p>

          <img src="images/diy-natural.png" alt="DIY Natural website" class="sidebyside">
          <p><br>
            I also looked at Cookpad, a recipe creating and
            sharing app, to get an idea of what to include
            for the recipe creation page. Although food
            recipes are different, so it was merely for inspiration.</p>

          <h5 id="survey" class="dest">User Survey</h5>
          <p>I conducted a survey to determine if and how users would use this type of app and what features to include.</p>
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hRdw43ILFYQMfItJgIh_ofUr9SB-BDsaZMnPC2Rl63g/edit?usp=sharing" class="button" target="_blank"><b>Survey Results</b></a>

          <ul>
            <li>70% would use cloud storage for DIY recipes</li>
          <li>75% use online storage with mobile devices</li>
          <li>74% collaborate through email</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Of the participants who would use cloud storage for DIY recipes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>100% would upload videos, images, PDFs, etc.</li>
          <li>83% would share recipes with others</li>

        </ul>
          <h5 id="persona" class="dest">User Personas</h5>
          <p>From the results of my survey, I came up with
            two personas. The users for this app include an
            enthusiast who wants to consolidate all the
            types of recipes she’s discovered in one place
            for herself and her family and a social media
            influencer who wants to create, organize, and
            share content in tandem with her social media channels.</p>

          <h5 id="story" class="dest">User Stories</h5>
          <p>In order to come up with plenty of stories to choose from, I thought of what general cloud storage users would want. After I generated some User Stories and prioritized them, I thought of what my niche users would specifically want and selected the following to focus on:</p>
          <div><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yp3IvLF_vxj9hWpyoGkDMqK_J89vOuur6ldvhgjkRTo/edit?usp=sharing" class="buttonp" target="_blank"><b>View Stories</b></a></div>

              <li>I want to create a recipe</li>
              <li>I want to upload files</li>
              <li>I want to share a file/folder</li>
              <li>I want to upgrade my plan</li>
            </ul>
          <h5 id="flow" class="dest">User Flows</h5>
          <p>From the User Stories, I iterated how users would perform each task. I intially chose Create Account, Sign In, Upload File, and Create File, but then to help create a more complete minimal viable product I added Select Plan to the Create Account flow and added Share File and Upgrade Plan.</p>

          <h5 id="wire" class="dest">Wireframes</h5>
          <p>After doing some Content Strategy, I sketched out and digitized the wireframes for each page needed in the User Flows. Moving from the aketches to the digital versions, I added the payment plans, testimonials, and footer to the landing page to again make a more complete minimal viable product. I also wireframed out each page for each step in each flow to help me visualize the flows better and how the prototype will work.</p>

          <h5 id="brand" class="dest">Branding</h5>
          <p>Looking again at those DIY recipe websites, I got some inspiration for how I want this app to look. I decided on a peaceful, bright, and modern brand.<br>
            Next I created a mood board and <a href="images/styleguide.pdf" target="_blank">style guide</a> to complete the branding process.
            The greens in the color pallette represent the peacefulness of nature and the pinks give it that bright pop.
            The ample white space and high contrast gives it that modern feel.</p>
          <img src="images/color-palette.png" alt="Color Palette">
          <p>I chose SeoulNamsan CB for the headers and Source Sans Pro as the complementary text. SeoulNamsan CB is sans serif and naturally bold to reflect the modern
            characteristic and humanist to look more flowy and natural. Source Sans Pro was chosen because it showed enough contrast to ensure proper hierarchy yet looked similar enough to promote continuity.</p>
          <img src="images/typography.png" alt="Typography">

          <h5>Logo Iterations</h5>
          <img src="images/logo-sketch1.png" alt="Logo sketches" class="sidebyside">
          <img src="images/logo-sketch2.png" alt="More logo sketches" class="sidebyside">
          <p>After a plethora of sketches of a potential logo, I took my favorites to the digital drawing board and initially decided on this:</p>
          <img src="images/logo1.png" alt="Logo 1st iteration">
          <p>I really liked how the M and G served as a visual representation of part of a flower, but the feedback I received was that it looked
            like a tooth and that a more abstract approach might work better. My second attempt looked like this:</p>
          <img src="images/logo2.png" alt="Logo 2nd iteration">
          <p>Now that the logo was more abstract, I was told that it would be better to type out Modern Garden and have the logo be separate to avoid confusion. Here’s the final version:</p>
          <img src="images/logo3.png" alt="Logo final iteration">

          <h5 id="prototype" class="dest">Hi-fi Mockup Iterations</h5>
          <img src="images/landing-page-hifi1.png" alt="Landing page 1st iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <img src="images/landing-page-full.png" alt="Landing page final iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <p id="caption">Dashboard Hi-fi Mockup, 1st and 2nd Iterations</p>
            <p>For a “modern” app, my 1st attempt was a little dated looking, but a few tweaks after some feedback got things going.</p>
          <img src="images/sign-up-hifi.png" alt="Sign up 1st iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <img src="images/sign-up-hifi1.png" alt="Sign up final iteration" class="sidebyside">
          <p id="caption">Sign-up Hi-fi Mockup, 1st and 2nd Iterations</p>
          <p>Making the images bigger and the logo smaller give the landing page more balance, expanding the colored sectional and
            skewing the edges makes the page more interesting, and the large thin arrows, shadowed cards for the plan types, and
            sharp edges all push it to that modern look. The pages with the form fields looked pretty good overall, I just removed
            the black borders around the field entries and gave them inner shadows which looks much sleeker.</p>

            <h5 id="preference" class="dest">Preference Test</h5>
            <p>I conducted some preference tests for the final logo design, and the mobile landing page. I learned that while the users give amazing feedback on your designs and can help you make better decisions, sometimes it's better to go with your gut.</p>
            <img src="images/final-logo-test.png" alt="Final Logo Preference Test" class="bigger">
            <p>While 67% prefer the iteration on the right, I actually prefer the left iteration as I like the text and image being roughly the same height, but I know it’s about what the user prefers.
              Since both iterations are strong choices, I would consider using both iterations depending on where the logo is being placed in regards to the
              rest of the content around in or what type of device the page is being viewed on.<br><br>

            <img src="images/mobile-home-test.png" alt="Mobile Landing Page Preference Test" class="bigger">
            <p>79% prefer the iteration on the right. I definitely agree with these results. I think the right iteration still maximizes the viewing space while looking more aligned and crisp.<br><br>
              <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/tests/50484493cf6/results/ac102f2678b0" target="_blank">See Results</a></p>

            <p>69% prefer the left iteration. One person also said that although they like how all 3 plans are visible in the one they chose, they also like the idea of graying out the less emphasized options.
              So, next I’ll toy around with the idea of incorporating gray into the left iteration or just leaving it as it is. Although I really like the idea of the right iteration, I agree that having all
              3 plans visible looks more clear and doesn’t give the user as much “work to do” (ie: scroll side to side to view options).<br><br>

          <h5 id="test2" class="dest">Another Usability Test</h5>
          <p>I did another round of usability tests with my mockups and made the following changes based on the results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Raise hierarchy of headline on landing page (ie: larger font)</li>
            <li>Add “... and more!” after “paints/dyes” on landing page to indicate options not limited.</li>
            <li>Bold “upgrade storage” on dashboard</li>
            <li>More options on sidebar of dashboard (recent and favorites)</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Which created the final product:</p>

          <p>I found that off the bat, I nailed the color scheme. There was good balance of negative space and contrast in colors.
            However, I didn’t have a good eye for modern design, but after some guidance from the lead designer I was able to re-imagine
            my ideas into a more appealing site. As a junior designer with only one project under my belt thus far, I had plenty of doubts
            in my ability in general. There’s a reason the design process exists though. It really helps you walk through every detail and
            make informed design decisions. Constant feedback and iterations is also key. As I keep practicing I’ll only get better and faster.
            With more time I probably would’ve included more detail and functionality. I learned a lot about borders, shadows, iconography, and
            how they’re all incorporated to portray the branding accurately. I’ll use this to make my first iterations a bit more solid and fleshed
            out so that subsequent iterations can be even more detailed and refined.</p>
