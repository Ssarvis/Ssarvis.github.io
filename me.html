        <h4><b>Summary</b></h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
        Renowned for its impressive dialogue system and epic storytelling,
        Mass Effect is a sci-fi action role-playing third-person shooter,
        the first installment in a trilogy. However, some fans have been critical of its UI,
        so I wanted to try my hand at improving the user experience using updated UI design concepts and methodologies.
        </p>
        <div class="takeaway">
          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>Since Mass Effect is a large game with a lot of menus, I decided to focus on the equipment screen of the PC version, where users had the following issues:
            <ol>
              <li>Inability to see all items for all characters</li>
              <li>Wasted space/ inadequate number of items displayed at once</li>
              <li>Underuse of visual aids</li>
              <li>Inability to see how weapon upgrades improve weapon</li>
              <li>Inconsistent/unclear iconography</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <p>A re-design including more color contrast, more displayed information, re-vamped iconography, and accessibility to all squad members’ items.</p>

        <hr>
        <h5 id="comp" class="dest">Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <p>To get a better idea of what makes game UI “good,” I conducted a
          competitive analysis between three games that are celebrated for their
          UI: Dead Space, Persona 5, and Tomb Raider (2013). From this analysis,
          I concluded that perfection is not possible due to subjectivity and scope.
          Although players prefer consistency, functionality, and visual appeal.</p>

                <li>Player character interacts with UI believably</li>

              <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
              <ul>

                <li>Inability to pause can frustrate gamers in a hurry/emergency</li>

        <h5 id="survey" class="dest">User Survey</h5>
        <p>I conducted a survey showing participants the original screenshots from Mass Effect and asking about what they thought about certain elements in the UI.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwt_iDtM89nVO9VZYo6RszCp0VlIkPvTyOwYaRH3RVDtczKg/viewform?usp=sf_link" class="buttonp" target="_blank"><b>Survey</b></a>
        <p>What makes UI enjoyable for users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Responsiveness, communicativeness, vibrant contrast</li>
          <li>Easy access to switching weapons, clearly titles pages, easy navigation</li>
          <li>Layout, information density, organized equipment menu</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How users feel about Mass Effect's current UI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bland and minimalistic, not high contrast</li>
          <li>Symbols are a bit vague</li>
          <li>Not enough info</li>
        </ul>
          <h5 id="persona" class="dest">User Personas</h5>
          <p>From my survey, I was able to create 3 personas representing the users
            interested in video game UI. One represents someone who works in the game
            industry and is very knowledgeable about game UI, one represents a more
            casual player who is a fan of the game, and one represents a player who
            is not familiar with the Mass Effect franchise, but is still knowledgeable
            about game UI and loves games with mods..</p>

          <h5 id="brand" class="dest">Branding</h5>
          <p>As this is a redesign, I wanted to maintain the original look, but at the same time give it a more modern feel.
            I took screenshots of the original screens and used the color picker to see all of the colors that were used.
            I scaled that down into a color palette. I also researched what typeface was used for the original and found a
            google font very similar to that. I played around with that typeface to figure out sizes and weights I wanted to
            use and also found a complementary typeface that helped maintain the futuristic look, but was better suited for
            long paragraphs. I consolidated these assets along with some button and iconography work into a <a href="images/me_style_guide.pdf" target="_blank">style guide.</a>

            <p>I generated some Hi-Fi Mockups and turned them into a Prototype.
              After some feedback on the visual success of the still mockups and
              the first round of user testing, I successfully made the screen easier
              to read with more negative space. The first iteration was a little busy
              and more prone to eye fatigue. My second attempt displays the same amount
              of information more effectively and is also more accessible.</p>

          <h5 id="test2" class="dest">Usability Tests</h5>
          <p>After more testing of my prototype, I made the following changes to create a third iteration:</p>
          <ul>

          <p>I got one more round of feedback on my prototype. The following changes were made to make the final iteration:</p>

            <li>Remove boxes around "Equipped Items" and "Inventory" sections and insert thin line between them instead, increase space between them as well</li>

            <li>Round the scroll bar and make it thinner, create more space in list</li>
            <li>Make the list on the right mimic the list on the left (remove bars and borders, lighten un-selected items and place thin line between items).</li>

          <h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
          <hr>
          <p>For this project I wanted to focus on my visual/UI design skills.
            I feel fairly pleased with my image editing and iconography creation
            skills and will continue to practice and hone them for future projects.
            I found that there’s so many possibilities in game UI and no single “right way”
            to go about it. What some users liked or thought was obvious, others did not.
            If I had more time, I would create hover states for every clickable item in the
            prototype, create a details page for every equipped item, have every item type
            clickable/viewable (can only view assault rifle and shotgun currently), cut/paste
            images of all squad members in the game so you can actually switch characters, and
            maybe even create a separate prototype for a console version as that interface would need to function differently.</p>
